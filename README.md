# Exploratory Data Analysis of Olympic Dataset

This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Olympic data retrieved from two CSV files: `athlete_events.csv` and `noc_regions.csv`. The dataset `athlete_events.csv` was too large to include but can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).

## Project Overview
The analysis focuses on exploring and merging the provided datasets, `athlete_events.csv` and `noc_regions.csv`, to derive insights into the historical trends and patterns in Olympic events.

### Hypotheses Tested
1. **Younger Athletes' Performance**: Investigating whether athletes who are younger tend to perform better in the Olympics.
2. **Gymnastics Performance**: Exploring if athletes with lesser heights and younger age have notable performance records in gymnastics events.
3. **Height and Medal Wins**: Analyzing if taller athletes have a higher likelihood of winning medals.

## Data Files
- `athlete_events.csv`: Olympic dataset (large, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)).
- `noc_regions.csv`: Dataset containing National Olympic Committee codes and corresponding regions.

### Methodology
The project involves merging the datasets, cleaning the data, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing trends to validate or reject the stated hypotheses.

#### Steps Undertaken
1. Data Collection: Obtained from Kaggle dataset repository.
2. Data Merging: Combining `athlete_events.csv` and `noc_regions.csv`.
3. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical analysis and visualization to understand athlete demographics, performance trends, and medal distributions.
5. Hypothesis Testing: Utilizing statistical methods to test the formulated hypotheses.
6. Visualization: Presenting findings through informative charts and graphs.

### Results and Insights
The analysis revealed significant insights into the performance of athletes across various age groups, heights, and Olympic disciplines. The hypotheses were tested and validated/invalidated based on statistical analyses.

#### Summary of Findings
1. **Younger Athletes' Performance**:

## Conclusion
This EDA project aimed to explore the Olympic dataset, merging two distinct files, and testing hypotheses related to athlete performance factors. The findings shed light on trends and correlations within the Olympic events dataset.
